# Computer-Vision-Projects

Welcome to the Computer Vision Projects repository! This collection comprises eight projects covering a diverse range of topics in computer vision. Each project aims to explore fundamental concepts and techniques in image processing and analysis. Below is a brief overview of the projects and their purpose included:

1. **Binary and Non-Binary Thresholding**:
   - Removal of object noise (salt) and background noise (pepper).

2. **Bi-Means Automatic Threshold Selection**:
   - Enables adaptive image thresholding to effectively separate foreground and background.

3. **5x5 Averaging and Corner-Preserve Averaging**:
   - Reduces noise for image enhancement and smoothing.

4. **Morphology Operations**:
   - Utilizes morphology operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing for object extraction and image enhancement.

5. **Connected Components in Binary Images**:
   - Identifies and labels connected components in binary images for object shape analysis and segementation.

6. **Gradient and Zero-Crossing Edge Detectors**:
   - Detects edges in images.

7. **Hough Transform**:
   - Detects straight lines and shapes in images.

8. **Chain Code**:
   - Used for image compression and object shape analysis.
