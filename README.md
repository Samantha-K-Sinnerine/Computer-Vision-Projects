# Computer-Vision-Projects

Welcome to the Computer Vision Projects repository! This collection comprises eight projects covering a diverse range of topics in computer vision. Each project aims to explore fundamental concepts and techniques in image processing and analysis. Below is a brief overview of the projects and their purpose included:

1. **Binary and Non-Binary Thresholding**:
   - Given a grey-scale image and a threshold value, the binary/non-binary threshold operation is to transform pixels in the input image (imgIn) from grey-scale to binary/non-binary values in the output image (imgOut) where imgIn (i, j) >= threshold value. This allows for the removal of object noise (salt) and background noise (pepper).

2. **Bi-Means Automatic Threshold Selection**:
   - Given the histogram of a gray-scale image, this project implements the Bi-Means algorithm to automatically determine the optimal thresholds for image segmentation, simplifying the process of separating foreground and background regions.

3. **5x5 Averaging and Corner-Preserve Averaging**:
   - Reduces noise for image enhancement and smoothing.

4. **Morphology Operations**:
   - Utilizes morphology operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing for object extraction and image enhancement.

5. **Connected Components in Binary Images**:
   - Identifies and labels connected components in binary images for object shape analysis and segementation.

6. **Gradient and Zero-Crossing Edge Detectors**:
   - Detects edges in images.

7. **Hough Transform**:
   - Detects straight lines and shapes in images.

8. **Chain Code**:
   - Used for image compression and object shape analysis.
